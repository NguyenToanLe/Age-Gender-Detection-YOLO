# Age Gender Detector

This project implements a semi-real-time age and gender detection application using a combination of pre-trained YOLOv8 
and fine-tuned YOLOv11 models from [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/). The application processes either a 
single image or a live video feed from a webcam, detects faces, and then predicts the age and gender of each detected 
individual.

The application is built with Python 3.10.3 and Gradio, providing a user-friendly web interface.

A demo can be found [here](https://nguyentoanle41-age-gender-detector.hf.space/).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

## 1. Features
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes a YOLOv8-based face detection model to accurately locate faces in images and video frames.
- **Age and Gender Classification**: Employs two separate YOLOv11 classification models, fine-tuned for age and gender
prediction.
- **Real-time Processing**: Supports real-time video processing from a webcam, with bounding boxes and predictions
displayed directly on the video feed.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface is provided by Gradio, allowing users to easily 
upload images or use their camera for live feeding. A demo can be found 
[here](https://nguyentoanle41-age-gender-detector.hf.space/).

## 2. Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- `pip` package manager.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/NguyenToanLe/Age-Gender-Detection-YOLO.git
cd Age-Gender-Detection-YOLO
```

2. Install the required Python packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. How to Run

If you don't want to use web interface, you can directly run `predictor.py` script. This will make the detection via 
live camera usage smoother.
```python
python predictor.py
```

To start the application via web interface locally, simply run the `app.py` script from your terminal. Either use on of
these two commands:
```python
python app.py
gradio app.py
```
This will launch a Gradio server. You can access the application by navigating to the local URL provided in the terminal 
output (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`). With the second command, the web-app will be automatically updated when you make 
change in `app.py` script.

## 4. Model Training and Datasets

The age and gender classification models were fine-tuned separately. The notebooks used for training are available in 
the `notebooks/` directory.

### Datasets
#### Age Classification
The model for age prediction was fine-tuned on 
[Age-Classification-Set](https://huggingface.co/datasets/prithivMLmods/Age-Classification-Set) dataset, which consists 
of images of faces with corresponding age range labels. There are five age groups: `0-12, 13-20, 21-44, 45-64, 65+`. 

There are `19016` images, with the distribution as following:

- `0-12`: 2193 samples
- `13-20`: 1779 samples
- `21-44`: 9999 samples
- `45-64`: 3785 samples
- `65+`: 1260 samples

Because the number of `21-44` group is exceeded, the number of these images is randomly reduced to `4000` samples 
(comparable to the second most class in the dataset, `45-64`).

Then these images were split with the ratios `train : eval : test = 8 : 1 : 1` evenly to ensure a balanced distribution 
across different age groups, which is crucial for achieving high accuracy.

#### Gender Classification
The model for gender prediction was fined-tuned on 
[gender-classification](https://huggingface.co/datasets/myvision/gender-classification) dataset, which consists of
images of faces with corresponding gender, either `female` or `male`. 

This dataset was already split into `train, eval, test` sets with the number of images in each set as following:

- `train`: 5000 samples
- `eval`: 1000 samples
- `test`: 1000 samples

## 5. Performance Results

#### Age Classification Report

This classifier was trained with `50` epochs and images were reduced to the size of `64`. This model reaches the overall
accuracy of `79.14%`. The detailed performance is given by the table and confusion matrix below.

| Age Groups | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|------------|----------:|-------:|---------:|
| 0-12       |      0.89 |   0.95 |     0.92 |
| 13-20      |      0.69 |   0.61 |     0.65 |
| 21-44      |      0.77 |   0.75 |     0.76 |
| 45-64      |      0.79 |   0.82 |     0.80 |
| 65+        |      0.78 |   0.83 |     0.80 |
</div>

The metrics show that the model still confuse between two adjacent groups, except for the youngest group. This can be 
improve through hyperparameter tuning or through the enhancement of the dataset.

#### Gender Classification Report

This classifier was trained with `10` epochs and images were reduced to the size of `64`. This model reaches the overall
accuracy of `92.50%`. The detailed performance is given by the table and confusion matrix below.

<div style="margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
            width: 50%">

| Gender | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|--------|----------:|-------:|---------:|
| female |      0.94 |   0.91 |     0.92 |
| male   |      0.91 |   0.94 |     0.93 |
</div>

The classifier can improve in performance through hyperparameter tuning (e.g., increasing epochs because the training
process did not reach the overfitting point).
